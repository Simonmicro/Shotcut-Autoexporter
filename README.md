# How to use #
* Make sure `python3` is installed!
* Just start the script with `./exporter.py` and paste a project folder into the `input` folder.
* MAKE SURE all sources are directly inside the project folders root (otherwise they will be ignored)
* Create a new file named `OK` after the transfer into the `input` folder is finished.
* Wait until the project folders pop up inside the `success` or `failure` folders...
