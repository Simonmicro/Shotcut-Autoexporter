# How to use #
* Make sure `python3` is installed!
* Execute `exporter.py` or `service.sh` to add automatic restarts on crashs
* Paste at least one project folder into the `input` folder - MAKE SURE all sources (pictures, videos) are directly inside the project folders root (otherwise they will be ignored)
* Create a new file named `OK` after the transfer is complete inside the `input` folder
* Wait up to 10 seconds...
* The project will be moved into the `processing` stage
* Then wait until the project folder(s) pop up inside the `success` or `failure` subfolders of `output`...
